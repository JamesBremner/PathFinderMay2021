# PathFinder Engine
Discover optimum path through a graph of costed links.  

# Costs
An application that inputs links, link costs, starting and ending nodes, then uses the PathFinder engine to find optimal path.

# Turns
An application that models a robot that can travel either "forwards" or "backwards". The robot moves through a graph whose links may be traversed only forwards, only backwards or in either direction. The robot can turn around only at certain nodes.  Uses the PathFinder engine find the optimal path.

# Hills
An application that finds a path through a grid of points with different elevations that minimises the changes in elevation. Uses the PathFinder engine find the optimal path.
