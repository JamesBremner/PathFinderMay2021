# PathFinder Engine
Discover optimum path through graphs of costed links

# Costs
A straightforward application that inputs links, link costs, starting and ending nodes, then uses the PathFinder engine to find optimal path.

# Turns
An application that models a robot that can travel "forwards" or "backwardds" moving through a graph whose links may be traversed only forwards, only backwards or in either direction. The robot can turn around only at certain nodes.
